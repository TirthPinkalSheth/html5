    <p>Sanchi Stupa is a Buddhist monument, positioned approximately 50 km from Bhopal and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The stupas had been built around the 3rd century with the aid of king Ashoka, a renowned follower of Buddhism. Stupas are large hemispherical domes, in which Buddha's relics have been kept of their critical chamber. One of the best-preserved stupas in India is the Sanchi Stupa. It is surrounded by using a railing with 4 carved gateways going through all the 4 directions. <br>
        Udayagiri caves are 5th-century rock-cut caves, this is the only website online that may be verifiably associated with a Gupta period monarch from its inscriptions. These caves house iconography of Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaktism (Durga), and Shaivism (Shiva). These monuments are blanketed through the Archeological Survey of India.
